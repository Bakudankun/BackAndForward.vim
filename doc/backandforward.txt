MAYBE FAQ					*backandforward-faq*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:	:Back goes wrong way.

A:	By defalt, the jump list changes very dynamically as you move the
	cursor. It is recommended to set 'jumpoptions' to "stack" to make the
	jump list more predictable.
