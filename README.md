# BackAndForward.vim

This is a simple plugin that adds `:Back` and `:Forward` commands which do
`<C-O>` and `<C-I>` but in file units, like going back and forward in web
browsers. Also, `<A-Left>` and `<A-Right>` are mapped to go back and forward by
default.

But, since the jump list changes very dynamically as you move the cursor, this
plugin is not helpful as you think.
